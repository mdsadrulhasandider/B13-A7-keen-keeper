## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 👫 Smart Friend Management
View all your friends in a clean 4-column grid. Each card shows the friend's photo, name, days since last contact, relationship tags (e.g., "work", "family"), and a color-coded status badge — **Overdue**, **Almost Due**, or **On-Track**.

### 2. ⚡ Quick Check-In with Timeline Logging
From any friend's detail page, use the **Quick Check-In** card to log a **Call**, **Text**, or **Video** interaction in one click. Each action instantly adds a timestamped entry to the global Timeline page with a toast notification confirming the log.

### 3. 📊 Friendship Analytics (Pie Chart)
The **Stats page** displays an interactive donut pie chart (built with Recharts) that breaks down your interaction history by type — Call, Text, and Video — giving you a visual overview of how you're staying connected.
